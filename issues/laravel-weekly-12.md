# Laravel Weekly #12

Hi there, welcome to the 12th issue of Laravel Weekly. Here's an overview of what happened last week and where you can find the latest Laravel resources.

Did you know that Laravel turned two last sunday (June 9)? I'm still amazed by how young this awesome framework is.

While the first batch of Laravel T-shirts are starting to reach their buyers, [the second batch](http://teespring.com/laravel-redux) of shirts has ended. It's now officially vintage!

See you next week for a new issue!
